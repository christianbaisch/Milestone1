When it comes to games, I don't see myself paying too much attention to the philisophical ideas that they can bring. I tend to shy away from story based games and usally focus on strictly gameplay mechanics. I don't care about making choices for a result in a game. I only care about beating the boss/oppenent I am against. Because of this, I usually do not play story based games. In the past I have played Bioshock, Skyrim, and The Witcher 3 but I rarely spend a lot of time with them. I am normally more concerned about beating/reach max level with them than I am with the story. This affects the type of games that I wish to make. I want to make something that gives the player a sense of satifaction that they were able to beat it; something that is challenging but keeps the player involved. Games should focus less ethics/moral issues and more on fun, interactive gameplay.
