Over the course of my time programming I have realized that the best method in trying to figure out how to fix/debug code is to use the code documentation such as https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference or using stack overflow. As an example, in my space shooter game I wanted to find all objects on stage with a specific tag. I searched the Unity Documentation and was brought to https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.html. If this doesn't solve my problem either StackOverflow or Youtube tutorial videos can also be a good reference. I have been coding on and off since 2015 so I am familiar what to do when I run into problems.
